<h1>Instructions for Using iQsign</h1>

<h2><a href="/about">About</a></h2>
<p>
iQsign is a platform that provides a web page and image that can both be easily
updated dynamically from the web.  The update can be done manually from the iQsign
web site. It can also be done automatically
using SmartThings either directly or through our controller. We also provide an
application that will manually or automatically update the sign based on a set of
rules you define.
</p>

<h2>Using iQsign</h2>
<p>
Once you register and log in to iQsign you will be placed on the page for
controlling your sign.	If you have multiple signs, then you will be placed
on a page that lets you select the sign of interest and then go to the page
for that sign.
</p>
<p>
On the page for your sign you can change the name (used for identifying which
sign when you have more than one), the default dimensions and scale (generally
you can scale the image to whatever size you want), the urls that you can link
to for either the image or an automatically updated web page, and the contents
of the sign (see below).  You can also save the current image with a given name
so it can be reloaded on demand.  There are also links to help you choose
images for your sign or to upload your own images (or ones from the web).
</p>
<h2>Sign Description</h2>
<p>
The sign itself is specified by a sequence of text lines, each line either
providing the description of a line of text, an image, or providing general
information such as the background color.
</p>
<p>
From this description, iQsign will create a sign.  The sign itself is divided
into regions as shown below:
</p>
<img alt='iQsign sign layout' src='/static/images/outline.png' class='img-fluid' />
<p>
iQsign will take the description and automatically layout the result, taking
into account what regions are present and which are absent, and scaling text
and images appropriately.
</p>

<h3>Global Lines</h3>
<p>
Global lines in the sign start with a percent sign (%).  Percent signs are also
used to indicate the remainder of the line is a comment on non-global lines.  On
a global line a percent sign followed by a space indicates the rest of the line
is a comment. Global commands are specified by %<command>.  The currently valid
commands include:

      <td>%bg &lt;color&gt;</td>
      <td>%bg ccccff</td>
      <td>Set the default background for the overall sign</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>&</td>
      <td>%</td>
      <td>Ignore the rest of the line (comment)</td>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Text Lines</h3>
<p>
Text lines start with either a number sign (#) or with any alphanumberic character.
The first text line goes into the Text 1 region, the second into the Text 2 region,
and so on.  A line with only a # sign can be used to indicate the corresponding
text regions is empty.	Plus signs(+) in the text are replaced with spaces.
</p>
<p>
Text line themselves consist of text and commands.  Commands start with a number
sign and are shown below.  An unescaped % sign (use \% to escape one), indicates
the rest of the line is a comment.  The currently valid commands include:

   </tr>

<h3>Image Lines</h3>
<p>
Image lines begin with an at sign (@).	Similar to text lines, the first image line
is used for image area 1, the second for image area 2, etc.  A line containing only an
at sign indicates the corresponding image will be skipped.
</p>
<p>
The text in an image line indicates the image.	This can be a URL, the name of an
image the user has previously saved with the system, or a special name indicating
either a font-awesome icon or an image from our svg library.  Font awesome images
have a name starting with fa- (e.g. fa-hippo).	SVG images have names starting
with sv- (e.g. sv-animals/sheep).  The sign maker provides a window for copying
the appropriate svg image to the clipboard so it can be pasted into the sign.
</p>
<p>
Image lines also support commands that start with an at sign.  These include:
