# IOT

This repository contains a set of projects designed to make controlling IoT
devices easier.  These include:

## iQsign

This is a cloud-based implementation of a smart sign.  It enables web or remote
control of a sign based on a simple description language.  It provides both a
web site that updates automatically and an image that it updates as requested for
each sign.  Users can register and control their signs.  iQsign is currently
available at `https://sherpa.cs.brown.edu:3336`

## signmaker

This is the utility that creates the sign images for iQsign from descriptions.

## Future Projects

### Phone app to control the iQsign

### SHERPA: an interval-based controller for IoT devices

### Phone app as an interface to SHERPA
