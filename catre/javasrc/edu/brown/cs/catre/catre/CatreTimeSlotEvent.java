/**
 *	A calendar event represents a series of time slots corresponding to
 *	an event specification.  It might be a one-shot event (i.e. 1/20/2013
 *	from 2:00pm to 4:00pm), or a repeated event (i.e. every Monday at noon,
 *	possibly with exceptions and with a start/stop date).  The basic
 *	idea is that however it is specified, it should be possible to deduce
 *	for a given time period, what time slots are covered by this event.
 *	This can be used both to find overlapping or conflicting events and
 *	to create triggers when events start/stop.
